## Learning Objectives

1. What is a skip connection?
   A skip connetion, also known as a shortcut connection, is a component in some neural network architectures, like ResNet, where the output form one layer is added to a later layer's output. this allows the gradients to flow directlye through the network during backpropagation, which helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and enables training of much deeper networks.

2. What is a bottleneck layer?
   Is a layer that contains fewer nodes (neurons) tha the precious layers. It's often used in deep convolutional architectures, like ResNet, and its purpose is to reduce dimensionality and teh compress the information the network has learned up to the point. This compression can help to improve computational efficiency, and it may also serce as a form of regularization, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data.

3. What is the Inception Network?
   Is a deep convolutional neuron network architecutre that was first introduced by reseachers at Google in a paper titled "Going Deeper with Convolutions" in 2014. The Network is named "Inception" after the meme "we need to go deeper", originating form the film Inception.

   Inception Networks are known for thein complex structure with "Inception modules". And inception models applies convolutions of different sizes (e.g, 1x1, 3x3, 5x5) and a 3x3 max pooling operation in parallel, concatenating their outputs along the channel dimension. This allows the network to learn different spatial hierarchies of features at each layer, effectively enabling it to learn more complex and flaxible representations.

   The most famous version of teh Inception network, Inception -v3, also incorporated techniques like factorization (breaking down large convolutions into smaller ones) and batch normalization (normalizing the activations of the network at each layer) to improve perfomrance and speed up training.

   One of the major benefits of Inception netowrks is that the drastically reduce the number of parameters and computational cost compared to other networks of their depht and with, making them more efficient.

4. What is ResNet? ResNeXt? DenseNet?
   ResNet: ResNet: short for Residual Networks, is a classic neural network model primarily used for image classification tasks. The ideas behind ResNet is introducing "shortcut connnections" or "skip connections", which allows the gradient to be directly backpropagatedto earlier layers. This helps to solve the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the training of very deep networks. The seminal paper proposing ResNet won the Best Paper Award at CVPR in 2016

   ResNeXt: Proposed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), ResNeXt, short for Residual Networks with NeXt-generation architecture, is an exptension of ResNet. Ut introduces the concept of "grouped convolutions" into the architecutre, which increases model capacity and performance without significant computational cost. The "NeXt" in ResNeXt" in ResNext stads for "Networks with 1,'X','X','X' dimension", where 'X' could be any number. The X's are placeholders that can be replaced with the depth, width and cardnality of the network.

   DenseNet: short for Densely Connected convolutional Networks, is another type of neural network architecture for image classification tasks. Its distinctive feature is that each layer is connected to every other layer i na feed-forward fashion. In other words, the ith layer receives feature-maps from all preceding layers. This has the effect of encouraging feature reuse throughout the network, and can result in fwewr parameters, less computation, and improved gradient flow compared to other architectures.
