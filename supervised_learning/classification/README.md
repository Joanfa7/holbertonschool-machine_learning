## Learning Objectives

1. What is a model?

   - a model in ML is a mathematical representation of a real-world process or system, created by learning patterns and relationships form data. It's used to make predictions or decisions based on new input data.

2. What is supervised learning?

   - Is a type of ML where the model is trained using labeled dataset. The dataset contain input-output pairs, where the outpu (or "label") is the correct anser of target value for a given input. The goal is for the model to learn the underlying patterns or relationships between inputs and outputs so it can make accurate predicitons for new, unseen data.

3. What is a prediction?

   - A prediction in ML is the output generated by a model whne it receives new input data. It's an estimate and the most likely outcome or response based on the patterns and relationship the model has learned form the training data. Predictions are used to make decisions or provide insights in various applicaitons, sucha as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendations systems.

4. What is a node?
   In the context of ML, partucularly Neural Networks, a node (also called a neuton or unit) is basic computation element that processes and stores information. Nodes reveice input from other nodes or external data, apply and activation funciton to the combined input, and generate an output. The output is then passed to other nodes or becomes the final output of the network. Nodes are interconnected with layers to form a complex network capable of learning complex patterns and relationship form data.

5. What is a weight?
   In ML, particularly i neural networks, a weight is a numerical value associated with the connection between two nodes. Wights determine the strenght and importance of the relationship between nodes in the network. During the training process, the weights are adjusted internatively to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual output. **The optimized weights allow the network to learn patterns and make accurate predicitons for new, unseen data**.

6. What is a bias?
   In ML, particularly in Neural Networks, bias is an additional parameter used alongside weights to fine-tune the output of a node. It represents an offset of intercept that adjusts the overall output value. Including bias allows the model to be more flexible an d

7. What are activation functions?
   Are mathematical funcitons used in artificial neural networks to introduce non-linearity and determine the output of a neuron based on its input.

   - Sigmoid?
     - The sigmoid function (logistic function) squashes input values into a range bewtween 0 and 1. It is defined as f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)). It's similar to sigmoid but with range, making it better suited for hiden layers.
   - Tanh?
     - The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) funciton sqashes input values into a range between -1 and 1. It defined as f(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)). It's similar to sigmoid but with a wider range, making it better suited to hidden layers.
   - ReLU?
     - The Rectified Linear Unit () function is a picewise linear function that sets all negative input values to zero and keeps positive input values unchanged. It is defined as f(x) = max(O,x). It helps to alleviate the vanishing gradiant problem and is commonly used in deep networks.
   - Softmax?
     - the softmax funciton is used for multi-class classification tasks. It transforms input values into probabilities that sum up to 1, making it suitable for output layers. It is defined as f(x_i) = exp(x_i)/Î£_j exp(x_j), where x_i is an input value and the sum runs over all input values.

8. What is a layer?
   - A layer in a neural network referes to a group of neurons that perfomr specific computations on the input data. Layers are organized sequentially, with each layer transormaing the output form the previous layer and passing it to the next one. IN general there are three types of layers in nerutal networks:
