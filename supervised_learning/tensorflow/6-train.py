'''
Write the function def train(X_train, Y_train, X_valid, Y_valid, layer_sizes, activations, alpha, iterations, save_path="/tmp/model.ckpt"): that builds, trains, and saves a neural network classifier:

X_train is a numpy.ndarray containing the training input data
Y_train is a numpy.ndarray containing the training labels
X_valid is a numpy.ndarray containing the validation input data
Y_valid is a numpy.ndarray containing the validation labels
layer_sizes is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
activations is a list containing the activation functions for each layer of the network
alpha is the learning rate
iterations is the number of iterations to train over
save_path designates where to save the model
Add the following to the graphâ€™s collection
placeholders x and y
tensors y_pred, loss, and accuracy
operation train_op
After every 100 iterations, the 0th iteration, and iterations iterations, print the following:
After {i} iterations: where i is the iteration
\tTraining Cost: {cost} where {cost} is the training cost
\tTraining Accuracy: {accuracy} where {accuracy} is the training accuracy
\tValidation Cost: {cost} where {cost} is the validation cost
\tValidation Accuracy: {accuracy} where {accuracy} is the validation accuracy
Reminder: the 0th iteration represents the model before any training has occurred
After training has completed, save the model to save_path
You may use the following imports:
calculate_accuracy = __import__('3-calculate_accuracy').calculate_accuracy
calculate_loss = __import__('4-calculate_loss').calculate_loss
create_placeholders = __import__('0-create_placeholders').create_placeholders
create_train_op = __import__('5-create_train_op').create_train_op
forward_prop = __import__('2-forward_prop').forward_prop
You are not allowed to use tf.saved_model
Returns: the path where the model was saved
