# Hidden Markov Models

## Learning Objectives

1. What is the Markov property?
    The Markov property, also known as the "memoryless property", is a fundamental concept in probability theory and forms the basis of Markov Models, including Hidden Markov Models.

    Definition:
        The Markov property states that the future stat of a process depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In other words, it has no "memory" of the past.
